# p3ppc.manualSkillInheritance
Makes it so you can choose which skills your Personas inherit during fusions instead of having them randomly chosen. Also available on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/434312)!

## Compatibility
### GamePass
This mod is only tested with the Steam version of P3P and will very likely not work with the GamePass version. If it doesn't work it will not be updated to work with the GamePass version. This is a very big mod that changes and adds a lot of code and I have no interest in rewriting it to work with GamePass.

### Other Mods
This mod will be incompatible with any others that edit facility\combine.bin (anything that edits the messages or textures in the velvet room) and must be placed below such mods otherwise the game will softlock when opening the skill inheritance menu. I am unaware of any mods that actually edit this file however so you should be fine, if you do know of any please let me know.

### Non-English Languages
The mod will work with non-English languages however the text and sprites in the velvet room will become English as I have edited facility\combine.bin. If anyone wants to translate the mod to another language then feel free to get in contact with me, I'd be happy to add options for other languages if someone else makes the necessary files.

## Configuration Options
This mod has a number of configurable options in places where there were multiple good options for UI design. All of these can be edited from the Configure Mod button in Reloaded and will apply in real-time (you can change them whilst in-game as long as you press save). For descriptions of all of the options, you can hover over them.

## Design Philoshiphy
Whilst designing this mod wherever possible I took inspiration (and often copied) from the design and functionality of P4G's skill inheritance menu as it is the first Persona game to have manual skill inheritance and the games generally have similar UI design.

The skills shown to you in the menu are the exact same ones that the Persona could randomly inherit so by using this you aren't cheating, just saving yourself a lot of time hoping for good rng :)

## Supporting Me
This mod has taken a lot of time and effort to ensure that it's as close to what it hypothetically would've been if done by Atlus as possible (my rough guesstimate is near 100 hours). If you appreciate the work I put into it I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/animatedswine) and a [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/AnimatedSwine) where you can donate to me. Anything is appreciated although nothing is necessary, knowing people enjoy and find my mods useful is support enough :)

## Special Thanks
I'd like to give a huge thanks to everyone who supported me during the development of this mod, in particular, everyone in this project's post in the [Persona Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/naoto) who gave thoughts, cheered me on, and more than a few times helped with the creation of art assets. I'm certain it wouldn't have turned out nearly as good as it did if I'd done it completely alone.
